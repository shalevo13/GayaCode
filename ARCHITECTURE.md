# GayaCode v2.0 - SOLID Architecture Refactor

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This refactor follows SOLID principles and implements proper separation of concerns:

### Core Components

#### 1. **Interfaces & Types** (`src/core/interfaces/Types.js`)
- **Single Responsibility**: Defines contracts and data structures
- **Interface Segregation**: Separate interfaces for different concerns
- Base classes and interfaces for all system components

#### 2. **Monitoring Strategies** (`src/monitoring/MonitoringStrategies.js`)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable monitoring implementations
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to add new monitoring strategies
- Process monitoring with high-precision timing

#### 3. **Calculation Strategies** (`src/calculations/CalculationStrategies.js`)
- **Single Responsibility**: Each strategy handles one calculation type
- Energy, CO₂, EcoScore, equivalences, and scaling calculations
- Configurable and extensible calculation methods

#### 4. **Utilities** (`src/utils/Formatters.js`)
- **DRY Principle**: Reusable formatting and validation functions
- File validation, energy/CO₂ formatting, performance metrics
- Pure functions with no side effects

#### 5. **Dashboard Components** (`src/dashboard/components/`)
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components
- `BasicComponents.js`: Header and QuickStats components
- `VisualizationComponents.js`: Carbon Flow and Virtual Forest animations
- Each component generates its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### 6. **Template Engine** (`src/dashboard/templates/TemplateEngine.js`)
- **Template Method Pattern**: Consistent HTML document structure
- Flexible template system for different dashboard layouts
- Separates presentation from business logic

#### 7. **Environmental Analyzer** (`src/analyzer/EnvironmentalAnalyzer.js`)
- **Dependency Injection**: Strategies injected through constructor
- **Single Responsibility**: Only orchestrates analysis workflow
- Clean separation between monitoring and calculation concerns

#### 8. **Dashboard Generator** (`src/dashboard/DashboardGenerator.js`)
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Uses component composition
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to add new dashboard sections
- Component-based dashboard generation

## 🎯 SOLID Principles Applied

### **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class has one reason to change
- Monitoring strategies only handle monitoring
- Calculation strategies only handle calculations
- Components only handle their specific UI concerns

### **O** - Open/Closed Principle
- Easy to add new monitoring strategies without changing existing code
- New calculation methods can be added without modifying the analyzer
- Dashboard components can be added without changing the generator

### **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- All strategies implement their respective interfaces correctly
- Components can be substituted without breaking the system
- Mock implementations can replace real ones for testing

### **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- Separate interfaces for monitoring, calculations, and components
- Classes only depend on interfaces they actually use
- No forced implementation of unused methods

### **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Analyzer depends on strategy interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Easy to mock dependencies for testing

## 🔧 Key Improvements

### **Modularity**
- Clear separation of concerns across multiple files
- Each file has a specific purpose and responsibility
- Easy to navigate and understand the codebase

### **Testability**
- Dependencies can be easily mocked
- Each component can be unit tested in isolation
- Strategy pattern enables testing different scenarios

### **Extensibility**
- New monitoring strategies can be added easily
- Dashboard components are pluggable
- Calculation methods can be extended without affecting other parts

### **Maintainability**
- Changes to one component don't affect others
- Clear interfaces make it easy to understand dependencies
- Code is self-documenting through good naming and structure

### **Performance**
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient canvas-based animations
- Optimized CSS and JavaScript generation

## 🎨 New Dashboard Features

### **Live Carbon Flow Visualization**
- Real-time animated carbon flow representation
- Particle system showing CO₂ emission flow
- Interactive hover effects with detailed metrics

### **Virtual Forest Impact**
- Animated tree visualization based on environmental impact
- Growing/shrinking trees based on eco score
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds with seasonal effects

### **Power Consumption Radar**
- Interactive radar chart showing multiple performance metrics
- Smooth animations and hover interactions
- Comprehensive system resource visualization

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Run analysis
node src/cli/index.js test-script.js

# Or use the advanced CLI
node src/cli/GayaCodeCLI.js test-script.js
```
